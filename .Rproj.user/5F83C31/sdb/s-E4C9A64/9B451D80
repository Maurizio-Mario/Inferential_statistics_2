Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, (orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).\n\n## Confidence intervals/hypothesis tests.\n_Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)._\n\nVitamin C delivery methods affect the tooth length of the guinea pigs?\nH0: true difference in means is equal to zero.\n\n### t-test\n\n```{r}\nwith(ToothGrowth, t.test(len[supp==\"OJ\"], len[supp==\"VC\"], paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE))\n```\n\nP-value of this test is 0.06. It could be interpreted as a lack of evidence to reject the null hypothesis. We cannot assume that the vitamin delivery method affect the tooth length.\n\nSame t test for the tooth length of the group with vitamin C dosage. \n\n```{r}\nwith(ToothGrowth, t.test(len[dose==2], len[dose==1], paired = FALSE, var.equal = TRUE))\n```\n\nWe can reject the null hypothesis. As consequence, we can assume that the means of dosage change from 1mg to 2mg creates an positive effect on tooth length.\n\n## Conclusions \n_State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions._\n\nI suppose that Guinea pigs were randomly assigned to random treatments. Hence, the tests used a methodology adapt to indipendent samples.\n\nThe method of supplement has appearently a limitate effect on tooth growth. More relevant is the increase of the dosage, which leads to an increased tooth growth.",
